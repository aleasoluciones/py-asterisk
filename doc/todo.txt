Todo List For py-Asterisk.

    - Import old public domain AGI.py or rewrite it. At the least refactor it
      to not be so terrible.

    - Status/ParkedCalls/ShowZapChannels/etc. can only be used asyncronously,
      they cannot be used to simply trigger sending of events. This is wrong,
      but how do I fix?

    - Automatic state tracking of some sort for richly typed object
      representations - ie. automatically Channel.state from the Manager
      object so that channels may be passed around irrelevant of their parent
      Manager object, and may be used without raising exceptions (for eg. when
      a channel no longer exists).

    - Go through and make stuff asynchronous again.

    - Create proper documentation.

    - Add 'asterisk-dialplan' tool for command-line editing of the dialplan.
      Extend pbx_config_mgr to send events when the dialplan is edited via
      pbx_config_mgr, and make some sort of persistence example using the
      synchronisation code for saving the changes across invocations.
